My name is Matteo La Cognata. I am a software engineer, a pizza lover and a guitar strummer. I am also a dad, and I love my family.

### what is Voxbox

Voxbox is a collection of open-source and propietary components I developed to orchestrate telephony services on a single or clustered group of servers, with particular attention to the needs of the carrier wholesale market. Voxbox is built for [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) servers with [Freeswitch](https://freeswitch.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Ruby](http://rubyonrails.org/). The web frontend was built in [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), and later migrated to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

The Voxbox project is now becoming something different. It is changing in the way it intends to deliver the service and in the core technologies utilized.
